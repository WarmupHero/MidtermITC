John had more than just a complex character to deal with whilst filming Crime and Punishment. 
He had a throat infection and broken ribs, but insists that it only added to his performance. 
I broke my ribs on the third day of filming. I was mentally, physically and emotionally exhausted - 
and the constant light can drive you mad. But in a twisted kind of way, it all helped me to understand 
Raskolnikov 
and why he behaves in the way that he does.
