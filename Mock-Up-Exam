Exam Instructions:
You have 15 minutes to login in the Virtual Machines and start the relevant tools (e.g. Anaconda).
For each question: create a python file:   
Q1  Q1-Lastname-Firstname.py
Q2  Q2-Lastname-Firstname.py
When finished: zip all the files in a file named: “LastName-id-midTerm-Exam.zip”
Submit the file in the blackboard:  /Term Exams/Midterm
The files should be able to be executed just running them: Any datafiles you have used have be in the same directory as the python files, no paths should be used.
Coding:
Use python, and related libraries, e.g., Json, csv, Pandas, numpy and a mysql (e.g. pymysql) connector. No other framework may be used.

Grading scale: US-Scale:


 Q1: Python: Pandas Data frames 50%
Instructions for Q1
Use Pandas Data frame to read the file “diamonds.csv”, and then write code in python for the following sub-questions. You will find diamonds online.
All sub-questions (1-6) should be in the same python file
For each question, before the code. paste the question itself in the python file as a comment
You should define a variable for each of the questions 1,2,3,4,5,6 named as: result1, result2, result3, result4, result5, result6 which should contain the answer and should be printed. E.g.
# Q1-1. Print the first 4 and last 4 rows of the Data frame
code  …
more code ….
result1=  code …
print (result1)

Q1 work to be done
Calculate the min, max and average value for the ‘dept’ column
List all the ‘cut’ values, each ‘cut’ value should appear once only
Count and print the number of ‘diamonds’ for each cut
Print the number of duplicated rows in the data frame
Remove the columns that are marked with x,y,z from the data frame
Print the rows for the diamonds where the cut is fair or very good



Q2: Database: 50%
Go to /assignments/Midterm.   You will find files: step-1-Create-DB.py and step-2-Populate-DB.py. It contains code to create and populate the DB. The DB contains two tables: one is about employees, while the second is about mentorships, i.e. who supervises whom and in what project.
Instructions for Q3 Create & Populate the database
(Note: the code has been tested with spyder, anaconda in Linux)
The connector from Python to MySQL is:  pymysql
Create the database and tables by running the: “step-1-create-DB.py”: you will need to set username and password of your own database
Populate the database by running “step-2-populate-DB.py”. Make sure that the directories are right, and you provide the correct password.
Inspect the database to make sure that all data have been inserted in the tables (you may need to run a select * command)


Q2: work to be done
Write queries on the database you have created. The queries should be in Python.
All sub-questions (1-10) should be in the same python file
For each question, before the code, paste the question itself in the python file as comment
You should define a variable for each of the questions 1,2,3,.. 10, named as: result1, result2, result3, … result10, which should contain the answer and should be printed. E.g.,
# Display the names of the courses and the term they are offered
code …
result1= more code
        print (result1)

Display the names of all suppliers, as well as their city
Display all the name of suppliers that start with ‘S’
Count the number of products and the number of unique products based on pname
Count the number of Red products
Which is the lightest product?
Sort products by product names, and then by product color
Sort product names by descending order
Display the number of products for each color;
What is the name of the supplier that supplied 200 units of product 1?
